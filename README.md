# Augmenting and Evaluating LLM systems on domain specific data.
Cut down repo for my thesis paper including the paper itself, as well as some data and machine evaluation used. 

The CSV file contains some data and evaluations made.

Th goal of this was to take different LLM based systems and evaluate their capabilites on difficult queries relating to accounting and finance.

The datasets were a few million tokens in length and were complex in nature.
